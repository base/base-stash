Base application smart plugin that adds methods to applications for stashing and restoring object states.

You might also be interested in [stash-object](https://github.com/doowb/stash-object).

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save base-stash
```

## Usage

```js
var stash = require('base-stash');
app.use(stash());
```

## API

### [.stash](index.js#L27)

Stash an object property from the app with an optional "name".

**Params**

* `prop` **{String}**: Property to stash (e.g. `options` or `cache`);
* `name` **{String}**: Name to use to "tag" the stash to restore from later.

**Example**

```js
app.stash('options');
```

### [.restore](index.js#L48)

Restore a previously stashed object. Optionally restore from a specific "name" that was used with `.stash`. When a "name" is not specified, the last stashed object is used.

**Params**

* `prop` **{String}**: Property to restore (e.g. `options` or `cache`);
* `name` **{String}**: Name used when stashing to restore directly to that spot.

**Example**

```js
app.restore('options');
```
